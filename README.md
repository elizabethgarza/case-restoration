# Purpose

The purpose of this experiment is to 
- restore missing capitalization in noisy user-generated text as is often found in text messages (SMS) or posts on social media, or even
- add capitalization to the output of machine translation and speech recognition to make them easier for humans to read, or even
- transfer the "style" of casing from one collection of documents to another.
